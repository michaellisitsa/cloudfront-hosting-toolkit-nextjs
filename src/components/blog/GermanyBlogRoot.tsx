                July is my last month here. I spent the first 2 weeks doing
                exams on various subjects from renewable energy (easier) to
                Concrete Design (much harder). It was a decent exam period but
                not for study. I did a lot of swimming at the local pool and
                found a million new ways to distract myself from exams. <br />
                <br />
                As soon as that boringness was over, I packed my things and went
                to Prague. Beautiful city, home of Absynth (the liquor under
                which Van Gogh cut off his own ear), home of crafty waiters who
                squeeze every last penny from the unwitting tourists and home of
                Franz Kafka.

                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="320" src={DSCF4993} width="240" />

                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                &nbsp;A little challenge: What are the three styles/periods of
                architecture displayed above. Hint: #2 in the top right-hand
                corner isn't one of the primary architectural epochs so extra
                points for a correct answer.
                <br />
                <br />
                After years of delaying, I finally got up the courage to do a
                self-supported bike tour. As most of you would agree, the
                Bavarian countryside was therefore a nice place to begin. So I
                borrowed a pretty awesome tent and portable cooker from Berti in
                my student house (thanks mate), packed my sleeping bag, a kg of
                potatos, onion, garlic, rice and some lentils and went on my
                way:
                <br />
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="240" src={DSCF5017} width="320" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                As luck would have it, the weather on launch day was remarkably
                cheery and the bike path along the Pegnitz river hilly but
                pristine. This of course set me up for a big let down in the
                next days, but I enjoyed while I could and went swimming in a
                lake:
                <br />
                <br />
                <a href="#" style={{}}>
                  <Image alt="" height="240" src={DSCF5047} width="320" />
                </a>
                <a href="#" style={{}}></a>
                That night it rained cats, dogs and I'm pretty sure a few cows.
                I was accordingly soaked, not helped by my lazy tent set-up
                skills. It eventually got better though. On Day 2, I was pushing
                the whole day to make it to Bayreuth through the hills. On Day
                3, I arrived onto the Main River, one of the major rivers in
                Germany and had a nice time going through all the small villages
                nestling this majestic river:
                <br />
                <br />
                The experience of riding through huge grasslands, through
                forests and on desolate country roads was well worth the effort
                of pushing up the hills and battling the rain. What really got
                to me about bicycle touring was the peace of setting up camp at
                night in a quiet little corner, putting the espresso pot on the
                cooker, stretching out the tent and admiring your little
                temporary corner of land, which will be home for those few
                hours:
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="480" src={DSCF5052} width="640" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                On the last night, I camped behind the sheds at a soccer oval. I
                used some abandoned concrete tank (left) as my lunch table and
                admired the trains going by at 200kph on the track nearby. It
                was raining on the last night as well, but learning my lesson
                from my first night, I put in all the tent pegs and stretched
                everying out tight so no water could collect on the sides.
                Wadayano! I woke up dry as a bone and cycled happily onwards to
                my destination city Lichtenfels. I was hoping to get to Leipzig
                in the 4 days but underestimated the hilly countryside.

                So as they say, all good things come to an end and so this blog
                post is gonna be my last. Next week I'll see you guys at uni or
                elsewhere and we'll catch up on all the interesting things I've
                missed in the fashion capital. Can't wait to be home!

                This month I've been cruising like Thorpie through the various
                events and challenges served onto my plate. Now I've got a
                little bit of pain with exams, but i've managed to fit in a few
                nice weekends and stuff and will share a few pictures as well:
                <br />
                <br />

                </a>
                Well first the group of exchange students went to visit some
                castles in southern bavaria. The most famous, and supposedly an
                inspiration for the sleeping beauty castle was Neuschwanstein
                (right). The castle is a massive and super luxurious thing with
                some of the coolest interior decoration i've ever witnessed. It
                was built by King Ludwig II who ended up running up a hell of a
                debt. He had namely a pretty castle addiction and went around
                building heaps of these things, most of them not even finished
                cause they were just way too grand and ambitious.

                That weekend we also went to a typical bavarian restaurants,
                they love their beer so much they even made a beer liquor served
                warm, was pretty tasty. There was dancing and heaps of chants
                that I didn't know. It was a good weekend overall.
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Paul visited me as well, that was nice of him. We had a good
                time for the one and a half days he was around. I showed him the
                german beer sorts. We also were gobsmacked by the difference in
                prices for groceries between Germany and Australia. And I'm not
                just talking about bananas which would be more economical grown
                on the moon than in oz. I'm talking about everything: Tomatoes
                0.99EUR/kg, Potatoes 1.99EUR/2.5kg, Can Kidney Beans 0.29EUR,
                Blueberries 1.49EUR/200g. The beer is also pretty cheap and I
                showed him the typical Weizenbier (or Wheat beer) that Paul's
                holding in the photo below. It's always served in those tall
                pint glasses (no such thing as a pot here), and foams up at the
                top heaps when first poured. Quite good actually:
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="240" src={DSCF4957} width="320" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                We went to the Documentation Centre which is a museum of nazi
                history. This was good. Here's a picture of europe and all the
                concentration camps spread all over. The black ones are
                extermination camps, the other ones are labour camps:
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="240" src={DSCF4958} width="320" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                It's upside down, but you can see that Germany only really had
                the labour camps, most of the extermination camps being located
                in the occupied eastern european countries That big grey part of
                the map (Grossdeutsches Reich) was the land they occupied during
                the war. As you probably know, germany is only a fraction of
                that size now.
                <br />
                <br />
                So time to sum it up. Things have been going good here. I'm done
                with exams in a week and a half. I've been swimming heaps --
                motivated by Ian Thorpe's return to the sport and wishing I
                could have a body like his: <br />

                I've been itching for a while to meet an Australian. Yes, true
                there's not many aussies here in nuremberg, but i was lucky to
                meet Katrina in a nearby city Erlangen and we had a nice day
                catching up.

                We had a nice talk about aussie politics and the differences
                between a latte in germany and australia. There is a huge
                difference, that namely being a kilogram of foam at the top.
                yeah weird ha! no one seems to understand it here. by the time
                i'm through with the foam, my throat is too bubbled up to even
                taste the coffee. germans!!! It was cool to catch up with an
                aussie, she also used to live in fitzroy and gave me some tips
                about moving out which is on the agenda as my youth allowance is
                kicking in... can't wait ! :)

                I was in Berlin again and now with my good friend Dries. It was
                wonderful! Really a city that is open to different people,
                different cultures. some pics: <br />

                Unfortunately not in the photos is my friend and former german
                tutor Anne. It was great catching up with her as well! we rode
                these really cool electra cruiser bikes around berlin, all the
                cool suburbs like Friedrichshain and Prenzlauer Berg. We went to
                a gay bar! Was nice had a mochito cocktail for the first time.{" "}

                <br />
                There were also protests about nuclear power on the
                brandenburger tor of all places. That was cool! The next day the
                government announced to close all its nuclear power plants by
                2023. Still a long time but hey they've reached the stage that
                the only solution to nuclear energy is no nuclear energy. just
                don't understand people who are thinking about starting it up in
                Australia when every other country is trying to get the heck
                away from it!:

                So it's only 7 weeks left but I'm happy and making the most of
                the last time here. This week I'm cooking for the whole floor in
                our student house (~20 people). Every week two different people
                cook for everybody else and what me and Benni have decided on
                was:
                <br />
                <br />
                <ul>
                  <li>Basmati Rice</li>
                  <li>Side of Dal (modelled on wholefoods dal)</li>
                  <li>Side of Kidney Bean Curry</li>
                  <li>
                    Salad Olivie (russian potato salad with pickles, carrots,
                    mayonnaise and normally meat but not on my watch)
                  </li>
                  <li>Oreo Pudding</li>
                </ul>
                Here was my first attempt at making Dal:
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="240" src={DSCF4953} width="320" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                Mmmm... appetising. No actually it's supposed to be a little
                more fluid spices need a rethink, but this was just a small
                batch for myself, i'm making it tomoz again and i'll make sure
                to go easy on the salt shaker and maybe a bit more coconut milk.
                Cooking is hard man, jesus christ sure glad i'm a vegetarian,
                would hate to have to learn all the meat recipes.
                <br />
                <br />
                So yeah that's a little cross section of my life at the moment.
                I'm having a really great time and having heaps of new
                experiences. The most interesting ones are above. The other more
                mundane things i won't bother you with (you know stuff like
                orgies, drug raves, pimping in amsterdam, who wants to here
                about that !!!) <br />
                <br />
                Almost forgot - I went to a rockabilly gig recently. was great
                we even stood up and danced to the old covers of johnny cash,
                tainted love, and sexual healing.
                <br />
                <br />
                see you (everyone) soon

                Hey,
                <br />
                <br />
                Cultural differences are one of those things that are hard to
                pinpoint but I've got a brilliant one here... Aussie's dress way
                more hip than Germans. I don't pretend to be the hippest
                dresser, but boy I miss seeing guys in tight jeans or girls in
                colourful skirts and fancy stockings. Here I feel that I'm
                dressed normally for young guys,, and frankly if I'm the norm
                then there's a problem somewhere!!!
                <br />
                <br />
                Berlin was an exception though and it's famed progressive and
                alternative culture didn't dissappoint in fashion sense:

                I miss Australia! It's not hard to spot the signs. Before my
                departure I couldn't NOT talk about germany, now I'm listening
                to MTR or 774 ABC Melbourne to hear the latest budget
                commentary, I've bought cds from The Waifs and Missy Higgins and
                outside my room hangs an Australian flag. I've always thought
                that Australia was a great country but sometimes you need a
                little distance to really remind you of that fact.
                <br />
                <br />
                Anyway, not to dwell. I did go to Amsterdam. It was the weekend
                of the royal wedding, and Amsterdam was celebrating its yearly
                "Queens Day" celebration. This is not, as I had thought, a day
                for Queen Elizabeth rather for dutch Queen Beatrix. There was a
                royal amount of drinking!
                <br />
                <br />
                I did get to stop by the Anne Frank Museum. Anne Frank, for
                those unaware, was a girl with jewish heritage that hid from the
                nazis in a secret anex in an Amsterdam house (below). She wrote
                consistently and very eloquently through her 2 years couped in
                the small space located above a factory. The hideout was
                unfortunately betrayed by a neighbour in 1944. She was sent to
                Auschwitz and only avoided direct death in gas chambers because
                she had just reached 15. At that time all children sent to
                Auschwitz 14 or younger were gassed. She succumbed to Typhus
                though and died while in captivity <br />

                  Well it's not gonna be a long post today. Noteworthy is my
                  trip hiking this weekend. I rode to Forchheim along the
                  Main-Danube-Canal and found a pretty isolated walking route.
                  Luckily I had my flashy new trecking gps (below) that got me
                  out of the really dense scrub. I also learned a cool trick
                  where you can use the sun and your watch as an analogue
                  compass. It actually works!
                  <a href="#">How to use..</a>
                  It's actually really easy to lose orientation in a forest,
                  first time I tried walking consistently north and unknowingly
                  did a 180 after around 10 minutes. How crazy is that!

                Hey,
                <br />
                <br />
                There's heaps to report on. Europe is getting warmer and warmer.
                That means... picnic!
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image
                      alt=""
                      height="240"
                      src={Sunday_Picnic}
                      width="320"

                So that's me on the Wöhrder Wiese near uni. Basically a really
                huge green field full of people playing soccer (rudely right
                over our heads). Taking advantage of the good weather, I also
                took a ride down the old Main Danube Canal that was constructed
                around 200 years ago.
                <br />
                <br />
                Canals were so nice back then, this one goes through a forest
                and there isn't a piece of concrete in sight. It's flat and
                every 300m there's a lock where the ships can be lowered. I
                think the reason for this is that if they left the canal at the
                same inclination as the landscape, then it would be fast flowing
                and carry sediments downstream. The new canals don't need as
                many locks because they are concrete lined and there's no risk
                of sediment build up. (don't quote me on that)
                <br />
                <br />
                Me and Edmund !!! met in Heidelberg, Germany:

                He was over to visit Ina and he treated me to a pleasant
                weekend. We went bike riding to Mannheim, we ate Kebabs (I
                falafel) and Edmund got to practice his German. He's very good
                and for how short of a time he's been learning it, I was pretty
                surprised at his ability and persistence,,, but in that regard
                no one ever doubted his persistence.
                <br />
                <br />
                We also went to the "Long Night of Museums". All the museums in
                town are open on one night till 2am and its kinda cool.&nbsp;
                Ed, his girlfriend, her sister, below, and me perused the city
                like Night-Owls:

                Well uni and stuff has been alright. Noteworthy this week we
                went to a blues club. The average age of patrons was 50, but
                there were a lot of talented musicians jamming away and entry
                was only 1 euro. One guy even looked like a cool version of Bill
                Young (our lecturer in australia, on the right with guitar). the
                blues were really jamming and a pleasant change from the student
                parties where you here really old pop like backstreet boys.

                Hey. I wanted to update you on Germany and the friends I've met
                and places I've been. Germany has been good and like everywhere
                else in the world, the people are friendly and there's always
                something to see and do.
                <br />
                <br />
                Like... the BMW exhibition <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="240" src={DSCF4770} width="320" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                or go to a bar...
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="240" src={DSCF4780} width="320" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="240" src={Zwinger_Bar} width="320" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                FYI the bar is a little cool place nestled in the city wall
                called "Zwinger Bar" (Swinger Bar), although I couldn't find any
                seedy partner sharing and I did look (NOT) :-( I always miss
                out!!! No but the old city walls are also home to the red light
                district, there must be something about the old stone walls that
                encourage people to go back to their primordial urges.
                <br />
                <br />
                Makes me wonder what happens on the other side of the Wailing
                Wall in Jerusalem. You only ever see the one side of it that
                crawls with scrawny religious folks. I bet on the other side its
                like a disco or gay club, well prob not but if it was that would
                be one step closer to sanity in the middle east.
                <br />
                <br />
                What else... Munich
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image
                      alt=""
                      height="240"
                      src={Ich_und_Dries_Olympisches_Stadion}
                      width="320"
                    />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Thats the olympic stadium where they held the games in 1972. On
                the right is Dries from Belgium and btw that picture above with
                the 5 of us is our little group of exchange students, the 2
                girls in the middle from Luxembourg and the one on the right
                from Austria and me with my ridiculously long arms above.
                <br />
                <br />
                Well there's not much more except... of course... I've got a
                bike.
                <br />
                That's very exciting and I went for a 50km ride yesterday,
                finally got my fix. But seriously, I find that a bike ride along
                a river bike path has healing powers, it's like an
                anti-depressant. Here's some pictures from the Pegnitz River
                bike path:

                So...
                <br />
                <br />
                It has been a week since I came to Nuremberg and a lot has
                happened in this time.
                <br />
                I want to introduce you to my student residence because its a
                fairly special place:
                <br />
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="400" src={DSCF4761} width="298" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                This 700 year old "Fachwerkhaus" or building where the wooden
                truss structure is visible from the exterior of the building
                lies in the Old City. Historically, the building was used a wine
                store and at times was also employed as a half-way house for
                lepers or poor families passing through the city. Since the 50s
                it has been refurbished into a student house and now I live
                there.
                <br />
                <br />
                Ok so first day, train at 200kmhr (some lines are 300kmhr) from
                Frankfurt to Nuremberg. I was met by weather from around 0 - 5
                degrees. That's somewhere between "Wow chilly" and "Hey are my
                fingers supposed to be blue?". No its actually not that bad and
                the really strong winter weather is luckily over and you see
                heaps of people hanging out in parks and on the streets:
                <br />
                <div className="separator" style={{}}>
                  <a href="#" style={{}}>
                    <Image alt="" height="300" src={DSCF4758} width="400" />
                  </a>
                </div>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Here's me with an Austrian friend Barbara also from our exchange
                program. We were going to the Albert Dürer House and Museum. For
                those not in the know including me, he's a famous painter. We
                also visited the Deutsche Bahn Museum which documents the
                history of trains (1835 - 2011) in Germany. Only England had
                functioning railway systems much earlier than 1835 and it's
                interesting to see the oft rapid progression of technology. For
                fans of Kraftwerk, we also saw the "Trans Europ Express" trains.
                Other highlights involve going to the zoo and visiting our
                primeape friend:

                She's female but sorry boys, she's taken, namely by a 195kg
                bohemoth Gorilla called Fritz and you don't mess with Fritz..
                putting on the ritz. Haven't got a picture of Fritz because he
                ripped the camera right out of my hands and gave out a roar
                who's shockwave probably tore down a few more buildings&nbsp; in
                NZ... yes i went there.
                <br />
                <br />
                Well I have to leave soon, but as a last little trinket here's
                another view of Nuremberg and I wish the best to all friends at
                home and feel free to ask any q's per facebook or otherwise{" "}
